# Library System README

## Introduction

Welcome to the Library System, a simple command-line application for managing a library. This program allows users to add books, borrow books, implement user authentication with hashing, and provides methods for listing all books, books overdue for return, and searching for books.

## Features

1. **Add Books:** Users can add new books to the library system. Each book entry includes information such as title, author, and publication date.

2. **Borrow Books:** Users can borrow books, and the system keeps track of the borrowed books, including the due date for return.

3. **User Authentication:** The system ensures secure user authentication by utilizing password hashing techniques. User credentials are stored securely to protect sensitive information.

4. **List All Books:** The program provides a method to display a list of all books in the library.

5. **Overdue Books:** Users can check for books that are overdue for return. The system highlights books that need to be returned beyond their due date.

6. **Search Books:** The application includes a search functionality that allows users to find specific books based on title, author, or other criteria.

## Future Enhancements

In future releases, we plan to expand the functionality of the Library System by incorporating a database. This database will enhance data persistence, allowing users to store and retrieve information across sessions. The introduction of a database will also pave the way for features such as user profiles, historical borrowing data, and advanced search capabilities.
